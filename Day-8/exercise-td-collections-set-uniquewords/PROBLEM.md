## Problem Statement: Set creation and sorting

This exercise should be completed using Test Driven Development Technique

  - Test classes provided in this exercise will show compilation errors, when the exercise is cloned locally
  - Classes and methods should be created by analysing the test code, so that there are no compilation errors
  - Functionality of methods should be completed, such that all the test cases pass 
  - Some of the requirements/hints are mentioned below
  
   In this problem, a Set of unique words should be returned from the input paragraph, based on the input order. 
        
        * Expected Order of Unique words is decided by an Enum containing following constants
                ALPHABETIC_ASCENDING    - unique words in ascending order
                ALPHABETIC_DESCENDING   - unique words in descending order
                LENGTH_THEN_ALPHABETIC_ASCENDING - unique words in ascending order of word length and then alphabetically ascending
                INPUT_ORDER             - unique words in the same order as appearing in the paragraph
        
## Instructions
- Take care of whitespace/trailing whitespace
- Do not change the provided class/method names unless instructed
- Ensure your code compiles without any errors/warning/deprecations
