## Problem Statement: Writing unit test cases for the given solution ##

**This exercise should be completed by writing unit test cases for the solution provided**

- Below is the summary of the solution provided
    - class `Student` 
        - contains parameterized constructor to initialize all properties
        - contains overridden `toString` method to display student details
    - class `UnderGraduate` 
        - contains parameterized constructor to initialize all properties
        - contains overridden `toString` method to display undergraduate student details
    - class `PostGraduate` 
        - contains parameterized constructor to initialize all properties
        - contains overridden `toString` method to display postgraduate student details
    - class `StudentService`
        - contains methods to create UnderGraduate and PostGraduate Student objects
 
- Create class `StudentTests` in package com.stackroute.oops       
     - Write unit test cases for checking the creation of UnderGraduate and PostGraduate Student objects with all properties being set properly.
     - Minimum test cases expected : 10

- Create class `UnderGraduateTests` in package com.stackroute.oops 
     - Write test cases for checking whether UnderGraduate is a sub type of Student
     - Write test cases for checking all properties are set when Undergraduate Student object is created  
     - Write test cases for checking the student details returned using toString() method. 
     - Minimum test cases expected : 3       

- Create class `PostGraduateTests` in package com.stackroute.oops 
     - Write test cases for checking whether PostGraduate is a sub type of Student
     - Write test cases for checking all properties are set when Postgraduate Student object is created  
     - Write test cases for checking the student details returned using toString() method. 
     - Minimum test cases expected : 3    

- Create class `StudentServiceTests` in package com.stackroute.oops 
     - Write test cases for checking object creation of UnderGraduate and PostGraduate with all properties
     - Minimum test cases expected: 2
